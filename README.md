# Time-off-Management-System
Java application with access levels (Employee, Manager, Administrator) for online time-off management in businesses.

The UI was built through Java.Swing, and supports all character sets for foreign use.

## Log-in
The application redirects all users to the log-in page, where username and password is asked for input. 

Since each user has a corresponding access level (Employee, Manager, or Administrator), once they log-in they will be redirected to the corresponding panel where they can use the methods of their role.

After log-in, a user can always click on the Home button at the top right, allowing them to log-out and log back in through a different account.
